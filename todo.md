# Plans for implementations and improvements

- Make site available from Mount Sinai. Improve security/encryption.

- Continue implementing tooltips and descriptions

- Enrichment analsis based on gene sets. Accessible on main page.

- Heritability feature on eigenegene network (waiting on Analysis from Linyao)

- Improve loading performance my migrating to a MySQL database (instead of sqlite3)

- Autocomplete in search

- STARNET logo and description page

- Search by list of SNPs. Returns supernetwork with highlight, on hover, of genome-wide significant eQTLs.

# Ideas

- locuszoom.js plots of eQTL on gene page

- Differential expression plots
